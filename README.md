# ðŸŒŸ Neural Network Implementation ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the Neural Network Implementation repository! This project demonstrates the implementation of a neural network for classification tasks using dermatology data.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This repository contains Python code that prepares dermatology data for classification using a neural network. It includes data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, splitting data into training and testing sets, and encoding categorical variables. The neural network model is built using the Keras library, with layers for input, hidden, and output, and trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function.

## ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation

The project evaluates the neural network model using stratified k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the model's performance. Confusion matrices are generated to visualize the classification results.

## âœ¨ Conclusion

This project provides a practical demonstration of building and evaluating a neural network model for classification tasks. By exploring the code and experimenting with different parameters, users can gain a deeper understanding of neural network implementation and performance evaluation.
