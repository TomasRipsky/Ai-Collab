# ðŸŒŸ Machine Learning Algorithms Evaluation ðŸ“Š

Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms Evaluation repository! This project aims to compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms - Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - using the Iris dataset.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This repository contains Python code that demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM algorithms for classification tasks using the Iris dataset. The code includes loading the dataset, training and testing the models, and evaluating their performance using various metrics.

## ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation

The project evaluates each algorithm's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices are generated to visualize the classification results and understand the models' behavior.

## âœ¨ Conclusion

In conclusion, each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses. Decision Tree offers transparency in decision-making but may overfit the data. KNN performs well with smaller datasets but can be computationally expensive with larger ones. SVM demonstrates robust performance, especially with the 'linear' kernel, but may be less interpretable. Ultimately, the choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the problem and the trade-offs between interpretability and performance.
